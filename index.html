      <h2>The Story of my adventurous Dad, the trailer, and our final adventure. Oh, and the pandemic</h2>
      <p>My dad is an adventurous soul. He has hike, skied, biked, backpacked, camped and traveled all over the world, but this story begins in the fall of 2019. My 90 year old father was in two auto accidents within 3 weeks.  He lived on his own out in California (my home state) and I, in Michigan.  I dropped what I was doing and flew out to California.  After handling some medical issues, insurance,…. it was time to head back to Michigan with my father and plan the next step.   But then there was this pandemic that hit.  We locked down and waited, and waited, and waited.  I had missed my son’s senior year of high school, birthdays, being with my daughter for her “virtual” college graduation, and just being there for my kids during this pandemic.  Now it was  we had to figure how to get back home to Michigan.   We couldn’t fly, or travel and stay in hotels with my elderly dad.  So what was the next best solution?  Road trip with the trailer!  So we turned it into an adventure.

               <h1>Big Sur - California</h1>
               <p1>Our first stop was Big Sur, California.  It just happened that we had some old neighbors that were also camping in Big Sur at the time, so we got to meet up with them as well.  We stayed at an enchanted campground on the banks of Big Sur River.  We saw McWay Falls that emptied into the ocean, went on some hikes and enjoyed the beautiful coastal mountains, redwoods and the coastline.

               <h1>The Oregon Coast</h1>
               <p>
                  While we were in Eugene, we took a day trip to the coast. We started in quaint fishing town, Florence. There were a lot of cool shops, delicious restaurants and of course, classic old fishing vessels. We next drove to see the Sea Lion caves near Hecta Head Lighthouse.  From there it was to see Thor’s Well in Yachats.  This was an amazing harsh blowhole along the ocean. The power of the force of water sure makes you think how how insignificant we really are. Our final destination was Newport. There we enjoyed a delicious bowl of chowder after walking around town.

                     From Oregon, we long hauled it to our next destination, Yellowstone.  I had a lot of expectation.  It was like being on the moon….

                     Always wanting to visit Mt Rushmore, I now had a chance to share the experience with my dad and my husband.  It was right before 4 of July and they had a bit of it closed off due to the celebration they were preparing for.

         <p id=testP class=funParagraph>To make lemonade out of lemons, without the pandemic, I don’t know if I would have had the opportunity to make the last cross-country trip with my dad.  We made it back home to Michigan and were greeted with sparkler and cake.  I will never forget the memories we made on this trip with my dad.  I will cherish them forever.
