         The Story of my adventurous Dad, the trailer, and our final adventure. Oh, and the pandemic
      </h2>
      <p>
         My dad is an adventurous soul. An avid photographer who has hiked, skied, biked, backpacked, camped and traveled all over the world. But, this story begins in the fall of 2019. My 90 year old father was in two auto accidents within 3 weeks.  He lived on his own out in California and I, in Michigan.  I dropped what I was doing and flew out to California.  After handling some medical issues, insurance…. it was time to head back to Michigan with my father and plan the next step.   But then there was this pandemic that hit.  We locked down and waited, and waited, and waited.  I had missed my son’s senior year of high school, birthdays, being with my daughter for her “virtual” college graduation, and just being there for my kids during this pandemic.  We had to figure how to get back home to Michigan.   We couldn’t fly, or travel and stay in hotels with my elderly dad.  So what was the next best solution?  Road trip with the trailer!  We turned a pandemic into an adventure that we would cherish forever.

               <h1>Big Sur - California</h1>
                  <p1>
                  Our first stop was Big Sur, California. This was our first camp trip on the central coast. We stayed at Riverside Campgrounds, an enchanted campground on the banks of Big Sur River.  It just happened that we had some old neighbors that were also visiting Big Sur at the time.  We met up with them for lunch and an afternoon hike.  We visited <a href="http://www.mcwayfalls.com" target="blank">McWay Falls</a>, at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park,  went on some hikes though the redwoods, and enjoyed the beautiful coastal mountains.  The redwoods and the central coastline of California is truly a special place to visit. I would like to go back and explore more.

               <h1>Eugene - Oregon</h1>
                  <p>
                     Our second stop was in Eugene, OR. My eldest daughter is earning her PHD at <a href="https://www.uoregon.edu" target="blank">University of Oregon</a>. Go Ducks! It was my first time visiting her in Oregon, where my dad has been before. We got to see where she lives, meet her roommates, have a wonderful evening cookout and play games. She toured us around the university, showed us her office building and where her classes are.  Because of the pandemic, we could not enter any of the buildings.  We also spent an afternoon touring her favorite spots around town.  We went wine tasting at a local <a href="https://sweetcheekswinery.com/?ag=1" target="blank">winery</a>, but my favorite activity was a sunset hike on <a href="https://www.eugene-or.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/-158" target="blank">Spencer’s Butte</a>.

               <h1>The Oregon Coast</h1>
                  <p>
                     While we were in Eugene, we took a day trip to the coast.  We started in the quaint fishing town of <a href="https://florencechamber.com" target="blank">Florence</a>.   There were a lot of artsy shops, delicious restaurants and of course, classic old fishing vessels.  From there we drove to view the <a href="https://www.sealioncaves.com" target="blank">Sea Lion Caves</a> near Hecta Head Lighthouse.  The cave is the largest sea cave in the US.  It was entertaining to watch the sea lions play and posture for space on the rocks.  Next on the list was the famous <a href="https://yachatsoregon.org/295/Thors-Well" target="blank">Thor’s Well</a> in Yachats.  The coastline here is rugged and powerful. Thor’s Well is famous for the (better description please) giant hole along the rocky coast.  The waves crash over and seem to disappear, them abruptly shoot up like a geyser.  The force of the water will make you respect the power of nature.  Our final destination was <a href="https://yachatsoregon.org/295/Thors-Well" target="blank">Newport</a>.  Newport is known for …..There we enjoyed a delicious bowl of chowder after walking around the fishing village.

               <h1>	McKenzie River Trail - Oregon
               </h1>
               <p>
                  Our final day trip in Oregon was to <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/travel/2021/10/waterfall-loop-on-mckenzie-river-is-a-perfect-hike-for-fall.html" target="blank">McKenzie River Waterfall Loop Trail.</a>. I have to say this was one of the most enchanted places I’ve ever been. It felt as if you were in a magical forest and little gnomes would peak around the trees, playing hide-n-seek. The forest floor was soft under your feet and the trees so green.  There was moss growing on the trees and rocks, but the most mesmerizing view was the water. The turquoise blue water appeared to be glowing from below. This was caused from ….. We hiked the 2 1/2 mile scenic loop.  The trail took us by two spectacular waterfalls, Koosah Falls  and Sahalie Falls, through the forest, ferns and across the glowing river.  We didn’t even put a dent along the 26 mile river trail. This is definitely a place to come back to and spend severals day exploring.

               <h1>	Yellowstone National Park - Idaho, Wyoming & Montana
               </h1>
                  <p>
                     Even thought it was sad to say “good-bye” to my daughter in Oregon, I was excited for out next destination.  It was a long drive, but be made it to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm" target="blank">Yellowstone National Park</a>. We arrived late and camped outside the national park at a KOA.  My dad had camped at this KOA years before and I was happy now to bring him back here to share the experience with him again.  We  only had one full day to explore the park, so we wanted to pack the highlights in.  We entered the park from the west entrance and drove to the Porcelain Basin Trail, then to the Black Basin Trail. From there we found a nice spot to picnic and explored Sheepeater Cliff.  It reminded me of Devil’s Postpile in Mammoth Lakes, CA.  We branched off toward the north entrance where we walked around some more geysers.   We saved the visit to Old Faithful for the next morning as we cut through the park to the east entrance and continued our way to Michigan. All in all, it was a unique experience.  It was not as I had envisioned; I expected a lush forest, but discoverd the moon. It is beautiful in its own way.

               <h1>	Mount Rushmore National Park
               </h1>
                  <p>
                     <a href="https://www.nps.gov/moru/index.htm" target="blank">Mount Rushmore</a> is located in the Black Hills of South Dakota.  Always wanting to visit Mt Rushmore, I now had a chance to share the experience with my dad and my husband, a first for all of us. It was a long drive from Yellowstone, but we did make it late afternoon.  It was July 2nd and they were setting up for a 4th of July celebration, so a bit of it was closed off in preparation.  I was in awe of the craftsmanship that went into this memorial and happy we were able to make this a part of our trip.

            <h1>The Final Haul</h1>	
               <p id=testP class=funParagraph>
                  From Mount Rushmore, it was “pedal to the metal”; well, as much as you can while pulling a trailer.  We had South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana to get through before the final haul in Michigan.  We encountered all sort of elements; rain, snow, smoke filled air from fires, severe thunderstorms, high winds, but we also encountered many days of sunshine and warmth. Having visited some of the most beautiful sites in the world, my favorite part of the trip was just being together. I am ever so grateful to have shared this trip with my dad and husband. We have since lost my dad and the memories created from this adventure, I will cherish forever in my heart.
